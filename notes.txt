Stages to ban: BF, SV, Hollow
- Light shoto
- SDI GnW nair up
- Every GnW player is a masher to some extent
^ I take that back. Methodical ones exist too. Versus methodical ones, be wary of how you use fruit. Use it as a way of threatening an option rather than just trying to use it
- Recover high to get away from chef
- Shield up b oos
- Be wary of bucket habits 
- Use fruit to contest the chef at ledge
- Be ready to react to grabs against grab heavy gnws. They like to put you in scenarios that make you feel like you‚Äôre safe to force a shield 
- Some GnW players (Maister) may like to go for dair on hydrant
- Be careful how you land with hydrant. Depending on the angle, it could be enough for gnw to go for an up b or an aerial

Ness
Things to watch out for: Ledge Expert, Back throw, all aerials

- If you shield pikmin they won‚Äôt latch on to you 
- Nair is prolly gonna be stale in this MU so don‚Äôt rely on it too much for your setups
- It‚Äôs very easy to tunnel vision certain things in this MU, but remember you‚Äôre fighting olimar not his pikmin
- Olimar can throw certain pikmin past the hydrant
- Olimar will likely recover high with no pikmin 
- Olimar is small af so true combos only
- Purples will never latch on to you. Treat them like a projectile war
- Don‚Äôt use side b offstage when pikmin are latched on to you
